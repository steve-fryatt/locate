Locate 2 Issues List
--------------------

* Status bar is not updated when saved results are loaded.

* Caret doesn't move correctly around search dialogue.

* Save search options from search dialogue does not capture current window
  contents.

* Check the correct behaviour of contents searches.

* File contents strings should be centred on match in window.

* Plugin support not implemented.

* Search history is not implemented.

* Loading saved results from Locate 1.

* What does Suppress Errors option actually do?!

* More generally, remove options that are no longer applicable.

* What does the Message_PreQuit handler do?!

* Adjust-click on the Hotlist menu drops the submenu.

* objbd_allocate() seems to return FALSE (ie. failed) if required allocation is
  smaller than that already available! Same may be true for results_allocate()?

* Running searches seems to pick up all filenames even if we don't collect all
  of the data?  This is because once a filename is put into the textdump there's
  currently no way to delete it, even if its parent object is deleted. Care
  needs to be taken if deleting, as a name might end up with multiple owners.
  
* There is no filetype check in file_create_from_saved() or
  hotlist_load_choices() -- the former is passed files from the commandline with
  not other checks; the latter loads files from Choices: in a similarly trusting
  manner. Test might want to be in discfile_open_read(), however.

* Should hotlist keep an "altered" flag and only save if its contents have
  changed?
