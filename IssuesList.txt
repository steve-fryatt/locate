Locate 2 Issues List
--------------------

* There's no duplicate checking when entering hotlist names.

* There is no filetype check in file_create_from_saved() or
  hotlist_load_choices() -- the former is passed files from the commandline with
  not other checks; the latter loads files from Choices: in a similarly trusting
  manner. Test might want to be in discfile_open_read(), however.

* Selection routines in hotlist need to take account of length of icon text.

* Make open/run operate on multi-selection results.

* Check the correct behaviour of contents searches.

* File contents strings should be centred on match in window.

* Plugin support not completely implemented.

* Loading saved results from Locate 1.

* objbd_allocate() seems to return FALSE (ie. failed) if required allocation is
  smaller than that already available! Same may be true for results_allocate()?

* Running searches seems to pick up all filenames even if we don't collect all
  of the data?  This is because once a filename is put into the textdump there's
  currently no way to delete it, even if its parent object is deleted. Care
  needs to be taken if deleting, as a name might end up with multiple owners.

* Should hotlist keep an "altered" flag and only save if its contents have
  changed?

* Status bar doesn't have an error count when files get reloaded.

* The Suppress Errors option probably needs implementing or removing!
