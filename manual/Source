<chapter title="Introduction" file="Introduction">

<cite>Locate</cite> is a file find utility for RISC&nbsp;OS.  It will search a specified directory for files that match a set of conditions.  These conditions include the filename (including wildcards), file size, modification date, filetype, attributes and contents.

<cite>Locate</cite> is loosely based on similar utilities available on other platforms: particularly the <cite>File Find</cite> tool that was once found on the '9x versions of <cite>Windows</cite>.

Note that with the arrival of <cite>Locate&nbsp;2</cite>, there are now two distinct versions of <cite>Locate</cite> in circulation. While they share the same name and outward appearance, internally they are very different pieces of software. <cite>Locate&nbsp;2</cite> will load search settings saved from the original, but will currently not load old results (although it can load settings from those files so that searches can be repeated) &ndash; this limitation might be removed in a future update. It will never be possible to load files saved from <cite>Locate&nbsp;2</cite> into the original version.

Unless it explicitly stated otherwise, references in this manual to &quot;Locate&quot; refer to <cite>Locate&nbsp;2</cite> &ndash; this is now the only supported version of the software.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Installing Locate" file="Installation">

<cite>Locate</cite> requires RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;4 or later; it might work with earlier versions, but requires the Nested Wimp and its use is unsupported.  It can be run off a hard disc or floppy disc.

To install <cite>Locate</cite> on a hard disc, copy the <file>!Locate</file> application to a suitable directory. If you have installed <cite>Locate</cite> using a package management system, then please refer to the instructions which came with that.

Under RISC&nbsp;OS <cite>Select</cite>, <cite>Locate</cite> will act as a <cite>Filer</cite> plugin for Find by default.  See the <link ref="Plugin">Filer Action Plugin</link> section for details of how to disable this feature.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Simple Searches" file="Simple">

To use <cite>Locate</cite>, start it in the usual way by double-clicking on its icon in a directory window (or via your preferred application launcher).  When the <cite>Locate</cite> icon appears on the iconbar, click <mouse>select</mouse> on it to open the <window>search</window> dialogue.

By default, <cite>Locate</cite> will validate the default search paths configured in the <icon>Search directories</icon> field of the <window>choices</window> dialogue when it loads. If any are invalid on the current machine (for example if the system only has USB-connected drives and therefore no ADFS, then the default path of <file>ADFS::4.$</file> will not exist), then it will warn of the problem and offer the option to edit the settings. Accepting this will open the <link ref="Configuration">choices dialogue</link>; otherwise the problem can be ignored and the paths left as they are &ndash; but they will need to be corrected in the <window>search</window> dialogue before a search can be carried out. This validation can be disabled from the <window>choices</window> dialogue if not required.

<subhead title="RISC OS Select Filer plugin">

If you have RISC&nbsp;OS <cite>Select</cite>, then <cite>Locate</cite> can also perform searches when the <menu>Find</menu> option in the <cite>Filer</cite> menu is used.  By default this will bypass the search window, simply searching for objects with the given name in the selected directories.  Unlike the <cite>Filer</cite>'s normal find option, the <cite>Locate</cite> plugin uses wildcards in the filename as described below.

To add more parameters to the search in this situation, stop the search from the <link ref="Results">results window menu</link> and use the <menu>Modify search...</menu> option.  It is possible to have the <menu>Find</menu> option open a search window instead of starting a search directly: to change the behaviour of the plugin, see the <link ref="Configuration">choices window</link>.  Instructions for disabling the plugin are also available in the <link ref="Plugin">Filer Action Plugin</link> section, to allow the standard Filer Action search to be used instead.




<subhead title="Setting the search directory">

Before searching, you must make sure that the <icon>Search in</icon> field contains the path-names of the directories that you wish to search, separated by commas.  All the files contained in these directories and their subdirectories will be checked recursively.  You can open all the directories shown to check their locations by double-clicking on the directory icon on the right of the field.

To change the location, you can simply type the required paths into the field.  However, it is easier to use drag-and-drop to change the location.  Dragging files, applications or directories into the field will add the paths of the objects to the list (files add the path of the parent directory).  Dragging with <key>shift</key> held down will <em>replace</em> the paths that are already shown with the new path.  Dragging the directory icon to the right of the field to a filer window will replace the field contents with the path of the directory.

If an object is dragged to <cite>Locate</cite>'s iconbar icon, the search window is opened ready to search that path.

<box type="info">
On most versions of RISC&nbsp;OS, you can drag the directory onto a Filer icon on the iconbar to set the search path to the default directory (usually the root on that drive).
</box>

The default path used for the search is set in the <link ref="Configuration">choices window</link>.




<subhead title="Entering the object (file) name">

Enter the name of the object that you are looking for into the <icon>Object name</icon> field. The criteria should be left as <menu>is equal to</menu> &ndash; see <link ref="Advanced">Advanced Use</link> for more details.

Names are matched exactly: <code>Report</code> would match <code>report</code> but not <code>Reporter</code>.  For more flexibility, wildcards are allowed.  <code>#</code> will match any single character, so <code>Reporte#</code> would match <code>Reporter</code> and <code>Reported</code> but not <code>Reporters</code>.  <code>*</code> will match any zero or more characters, so <code>Report*</code> would match <code>Report</code>, <code>Reported</code> etc.  Wildcards can appear anywhere in the name.  To search for a substring (in the same way that the Filer's search option does), put an asterisk at each end of the name (for example <code>*SubStr*</code>).

By default the case of the name is ignored; un-tick the <icon>Ignore case</icon> switch to cause the case to matter.

<box type="warning">
On RISC&nbsp;OS, all Filecore-based filing systems are case-insensitive: a file might be called File, FILE or file, but they would all be seen as the same by the filing system and only one can exist in any location at a time. Other systems &ndash; such as NFS shares over Sunfish &ndash; take account of case in filenames: File, FILE or file could all exist together in the same directory.
</box>



<subhead title="Starting the search">

Assuming that you don't care about any other properties (which will be covered later in the <link ref="Advanced">Advanced Use</link> section), click on <icon>Search</icon> to locate all the files with matching names.  After a short pause, the <link ref="Results">results window</link> will open and any matching objects will start to appear within it.  If any errors are returned by the filing system being searched (such as "broken directory"), <cite>Locate</cite> will remember them and continue the search in the parent directory to where the error occurred.  This means that any objects in the directory where the error occurred (including directories) that had not been checked will be missed; unfortunately it is not possible to just skip the object that caused the error, due to the way that RISC&nbsp;OS works.  Any errors encountered will be shown in the <window>results</window> window.

Clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on <icon>Cancel</icon> will close the <window>search</window> dialogue without performing the search; clicking with <mouse>adjust</mouse> will reset all the fields to their original values.

<subhead title="The search window menu">

Clicking <mouse>menu</mouse> will open a menu containing two options. <menu>Save search</menu> allows the settings in the search window to be saved for future use.  The settings are saved exactly as they are at that point, including remembering which options tab is visible (this is useful for setting up quick searches where only one specific parameter will change).  In a similar way, <menu>Add to hotlist...</menu> will add the settings to the <link ref="Hotlist">hotlist</link> for future use.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Viewing the results" file="Results">

The <window>results window</window> contains a list of the matching objects from a given search.  A full pathname is shown for each object, but they may be truncated from the start if they are too long to fit in the width: this in indicated by the name starting with '...'.  If this is the case, expanding the window will allow more of the names to be shown.

Clicking <mouse>select</mouse> or <mouse>adjust</mouse> will select items in the usual 'Filer' way.  If a search is continuing in the background, objects will be added to the window as they are found; the info field at the bottom of the window will show the directory currently being searched.  At the end of the search the number of matching objects and the number of errors that occurred will be shown instead.

Any errors that occurred during the search will be shown in the results window: they appear amongst the files, with a red 'hazard triangle' and their text in red.  The error returned is shown, along with the path of the directory being searched when the problem occurred.

<box type="info">
The directory reported for errors is the directory being searched at the time when the error occurred. Although in some cases &ndash; such as <cite>ArcFS</cite> errors &ndash; it can actually be the object causing the error, this isn't always the case as the fault could lie in one of the objects within the reported directory.
</box>

Double-clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on an object will Filer_Run it: files will be loaded, applications run and directories opened.  Holding down <key>shift</key> will have the expected effects: all files will be loaded into a text editor and application directories will be opened.  Double-clicking <mouse>adjust</mouse> will open the parent directory of the object (to 'view' it); this can also be done for the selected item from the menu.  Finally, objects and selections can be dragged out of the window to load them into applications; currently this will not work for Filer windows.

Selections can be made by clicking on items with <mouse>select</mouse> or <mouse>adjust</mouse> in the usual way; multiple objects can be altered at once by dragging a box around them with <mouse>select</mouse> or <mouse>adjust</mouse>. The box can be started over an area of the window that does not contain a selectable item, or by holding down <key>ctrl</key> while starting the drag.

If an entry in the window is greyed out, the object referred to has been moved since the results were generated.  This is most likely to occur if a set of results is saved and re-loaded, as all the file info details are re-scanned at this point; otherwise it will only occur if an attempt is made to double-click on an object that has moved.




<subhead title="The results window menu">

Clicking <mouse>menu</mouse> over the <window>results</window> window opens a menu giving various options relating to the results.  These are:

The <menu>Display</menu> submenu, which leads to the options <menu>Path only</menu> and <menu>Full info</menu>.  These toggle the display between only showing the path names of the objects and showing full details of size, type, attributes and the last-modified date.

<menu>Save</menu> leads to several save options.  <menu>Results</menu> leads to a save window allowing the results (and the search parameters that created them) to be saved out in a file that can be loaded back into <cite>Locate</cite>.  <menu>Path names</menu> will allow a list of all the path names (or the current selection) to be saved out as a text file.  Direct transfer to other applications is possible and the complete names (not the truncated ones shown) will be saved.  Finally, <menu>Search</menu> leads to a save window allowing the search parameters from the search to be <link ref="Hotlist">saved out in a file</link> that can be loaded back into <cite>Locate</cite>. Re-loading this file will open the search window exactly as it was when the search was carried out.

<box type="info">
Saved results files can be dragged to the <link ref="Hotlist">hotlist</link> in just the same way as saved parameter files: the settings used to generate the results will be added to the hotlist.
</box>

<menu>Select all</menu> will select all the items in the window.

<menu>Clear selection</menu> will de-select any selected items.

<menu>Object info</menu> leads to a window giving full details of the selected item.

<menu>Open parent</menu> opens the directory containing the object, in the same way as <mouse>adjust</mouse>-double-clicking on it.

<menu>Copy names</menu> will copy the names of the files (or those that are currently selected) on to the global clipboard, ready to be pasted into another application.

<menu>Modify search...</menu> opens a search window containing the parameters used before (clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on the iconbar icon always opens a blank <link ref="Simple">search window</link>, although <mouse>adjust</mouse> will recall the last search parameters used).  Note that you can only ever have one search window open at a time (but as many results windows as you have the free memory for - up to the application space limit of 28Kb or course...).

<menu>Add to hotlist...</menu> will add the parameters used for the search to the <link ref="Hotlist">hotlist</link>, opening a dialogue so that a name can be supplied for the new entry.

<menu>Stop search</menu> will halt a search that is continuing in the background, keeping the window open with the results that have been found so far.  You cannot re-start a stopped search.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Advanced Use" file="Advanced">

It is possible to make <cite>Locate</cite> check more than just the name of the objects being searched.  Options are also available for size, modification date (or age), object file type, attributes and contents; with the exception of the object name, they are split between several tabs &ndash; or sub-windows &ndash; in the <window>search</window> dialogue to make things easier.  To view and enter the options for a given attribute, click <mouse>select</mouse> on the relevant tab on the left of the <window>search</window> dialogue.  The options available are:

<list>
<li><link ref="Name">Object name</link>
<li><link ref="Size">File size</link>
<li><link ref="Date">Creation or modification date</link>
<li><link ref="Type">Object or file type</link>
<li><link ref="Attributes">Object attributes</link>
<li><link ref="Contents">File contents</link>
</list>

<box type="info">
All the criteria (object name, size, date or age, type, attributes and contents) are always active; it's not just the one that is visible when you click on <icon>Search</icon>.  This allows you to (say) search for "all text files between 1Kb and 10Kb in size, created before 27th January 1996, which are locked"; it can also be confusing if you forget that you set an option in a hidden tab.
</box>


<subhead title="Search options">

In addition to the matching critera, there are also various options that can be set to control how the search is carried out (and not what files are matched); these can be seen by clicking on <icon>Show search options</icon>.  The default settings can be changed from the <link ref="Configuration">choices window</link>.

By default, <cite>Locate</cite> will only record details of the files that match a search. By selecting <icon>Store all file details</icon>, it will record details of all the files that it scans in the search folder. At present this is not particularly useful, but paves the way for future additions to <cite>Locate</cite>'s abilities.

If an image filing system is causing errors to be generated when <cite>Locate</cite> tries to read the files within one of its image directories, select <icon>Ignore Image FS's contents</icon>.  This will cause <cite>Locate</cite> to check the name and attributes of the image file itself (for example a <cite>Spark</cite> archive) but not of the objects within it.  This is useful, for example, in the situation where you have <cite>ArcFS</cite> loaded and attempt to search a path containing Zip files; without this option on, <cite>ArcFS</cite> will halt the search with errors each time a Zip archive is encountered.

The <icon>Suppress FS errors</icon> is currently unused, as at present <cite>Locate&nbsp;2</cite> logs all errors in the <link ref="Results">results window</link>.

Finally, the <icon>Full info display</icon> option determines whether or not the <window>results</window> window starts off in path only or full info mode.




<subhead title="Recalling old searches">

<cite>Locate</cite> remembers the parameters used for the last search so that they can be re-used easily.  In addition, it is possible to save the parameters, either on their own or along with the results of a search, and re-load them later.  This is done from the <link ref="Results">results window menu</link>.

The <menu>Modify search...</menu> option in the <link ref="Results">results window menu</link> allows the a <window>search</window> dialogue containing the parameters that produced the results shown to be opened.  This also works with re-loaded results.

In addition, clicking <mouse>adjust</mouse> on the iconbar icon will open a <window>search</window> containing the parameters from the previous search.

More information on all of these options can be found in the section on <link ref="Hotlist">Saving Searches</link>.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Matching on object name" file="Name">

It is possible to match objects based on their names. This was briefly discussed in the section on <link ref="Simple">Simple Searches</link>, although some detail was left out.

By default, names are matched exactly to whatever is entered into the field to the right of <icon>Object name</icon> in the search window. Unlike other sections of the search options, where the default critera is <menu>is not important</menu>, the default critera for the object name is <menu>is equal to</menu> so as to give some compatibility with the behaviour of <cite>Locate&nbsp;1</cite>.

The requirement for an exact match means that <code>Report</code> would match <code>report</code> but not <code>Reporter</code>.  For more flexibility, wildcards are allowed.  <code>#</code> will match any single character, so <code>Reporte#</code> would match <code>Reporter</code> and <code>Reported</code> but not <code>Reporters</code>.  <code>*</code> will match any zero or more characters, so <code>Report*</code> would match <code>Report</code>, <code>Reported</code> etc.  Wildcards can appear anywhere in the name.  To search for a substring (in the same way that the Filer's search option does), put an asterisk at each end of the name (for example <code>*SubStr*</code>).

By selecting a criteria of <menu>is not equal to</menu>, objects can be made to match if their names do <em>not</em> match based on the rules given above. For compatibility with <cite>Locate&nbsp;1</cite>, leaving the <icon>Object name</icon> field blank or entering a single <code>*</code> will mean that the name is not tested; this can also be achieved by setting the critera to <menu>is not important</menu>.

By default the case of the name is ignored; un-tick the <icon>Ignore case</icon> switch to cause the case to matter (but remember that all RISC&nbsp;OS Filecore filing systems are case insensitive anyway).

</chapter>




<chapter title="Matching on File Size" file="Size">

To check for certain sizes of file, select the <icon>Size</icon> option in the left margin of the <link ref="Advanced">search dialogue</link>.  Choose a search criteria from the drop down list (the default is <menu>not important</menu> meaning that the size is ignored).  Having selected a criteria, it is possible to enter the required size(s) into the fields below; select the units required for each field.  The larger units match a spread either side of the specified size, so 1Kb would match from 1Kb-512bytes to 1Kb+512bytes.

Directories and applications will always match the size test, as their sizes are not very meaningful.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Matching on Creation or Modification Date" file="Date">

To check for certain modification dates, select <icon>Date</icon> in the left margin of the <link ref="Advanced">search dialogue</link>.  It is possible to specify this option in terms of an absolute date or as an 'age' relative to now: pick one using the options at the top left.  Only the selected item contributes to the search criteria: you cannot specify both date and age at the same time.

<box type="warning">
All dates and ages refer to the last time that an object was <em>modified</em>, and not when it was first created: RISC&nbsp;OS does not maintain separate creation and modification dates.
</box>

Again choose a search criteria.  If using the absolute date option, enter the dates and times as appropriate.  Dates are specified in the form 'DD/MM/YYYY' and are rounded up or down if being used as upper or lower limits.  To specify a specific time, increase this notation to 'DD/MM/YYYY.HH:MM'.

Clicking on the <icon>Set...</icon> button on the right of the date fields will open a dialogue box which allows the date to be set more easily (without remembering the order of the components demanded by <cite>Locate</cite>).  Enter the details in the box as required and click on <icon>Set</icon>.

If specifying the dates in terms of age, pick a unit from the drop down menu by the field and enter the required value. <menu>Exactly</menu> and <menu>Any age but</menu> match a window of the unit centred on the specified point in history: "exactly four months" would match a period of 15 days either side of the time four months ago when the search was started.

<box type="info">
Remember that dates and ages work in opposite directions: as dates get 'bigger' the objects get more recent; as ages get 'bigger' the objects get older. Also note that, unlike in <cite>Locate&nbsp;1</cite>, month and year now correctly take the calendar into account.
</box>

The datestamps of directories and applications are tested, but the results may not always be as expected.  For applications the Filer shows the datestamp to be that of the <file>!RunImage</file> file inside (if one is present).  <cite>Locate</cite> will check the datestamp of the application directory itself, as shown by using <command>*Info</command> at the command line.  Untyped files do not have datestamps, so these will <strong>always</strong> match whatever date constraints are set.

The default criteria for date is <menu>not important</menu>, meaning that the datestamp will be ignored.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Matching on Object or File Type" file="Type">

To check for certain object types, select <icon>Type</icon> in the left margin of the <link ref="Advanced">search dialogue</link>.  By default all objects (files, directories and applications) will be matched; deselect those that you don't care about from the list.

If you are matching files, you can also specify the types that you want to match or ignore.  Choose a matching criteria from the drop down list (the default is to match all types) and enter the types into the field below; these can either be hexadecimal numbers such as <code>ff9</code> or the textual equivalents such as <code>Sprite</code> (if one has been defined) or a mixture of the two.  To enter more than one type, separate them by commas; eg: <code>Sprite, JPEG, GIF, TIFF</code> would match Sprites, JPEGs, GIFs and TIFFs (it could just as well be entered as <code>Sprite, JPEG, 695, ff0</code> or even <code>ff9, c85, 695, ff0</code>).  Clicking on the pop-up menu to the right of the types field will give a list of filetypes for which names are currently known; other types can be entered into the field using their three-digit hexadecimal number.

<box type="info">
Unlike its predecessor, <cite>Locate&nbsp;2</cite> converts all filetypes in the list to numeric form before saving them: this means that saved settings will still work, even if they are loaded on a machine where some of the types have not been seen.
</box>

To match untyped files (those with real Load and Exec addresses), enter the special type <code>Untyped</code>.

Although image directories will be viewed as directories when actually looking for files to check (assuming their ImageFS is currently loaded and <icon>Ignore ImageFS's contents</icon> has not been ticked), their actual filetype is matched for the purposes of this test and they are treated as files.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Matching on Object attributes" file="Attributes">

To check the file attributes, select <icon>Attributes</icon> in the left margin of the <link ref="Advanced">search dialogue</link>.  To check a given attribute, select its entry and set the icons on the right as required.

All object types will be compared, even though it is not possible to give applications and directories private read and write access (at least under ADFS).  For this reason, <cite>Locate</cite> will only ever match files if these options are set to match <code>Yes</code>.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Matching on File contents" file="Contents">

To check the contents of files, select <icon>Contents</icon> in the left margin of the <link ref="Advanced">search dialogue</link>.  Pick the search criteria from the drop-down menu: the default is not to check the file contents.  In the field below, enter the text to search for; this text is looked for within the file and can contain the usual wildcards (<code>#</code> to match any single character and <code>*</code> to match any zero or more characters, both including control characters).  The text is matched case sensitively unless <icon>Ignore case</icon> is ticked.

If <icon>Allow control chars</icon> is selected, certain control characters can be entered using <code>\</code> sequences.  These are as follows:

<list>
<li><code>\a</code> - Bell (ASCII 7)
<li><code>\b</code> - Backspace (ASCII 8)
<li><code>\f</code> - Formfeed (ASCII 12)
<li><code>\n</code> - Newline (ASCII 10)
<li><code>\r</code> - Carriage Return (ASCII 13)
<li><code>\t</code> - Tab (ASCII 9)
<li><code>\v</code> - Vertical Tab (ASCII 11)
<li><code>\\</code> - Backslash (ASCII 92)
</list>

The codes are always case-insensitive (so <code>\t</code> and <code>\T</code> are the same whatever the setting of the <icon>Ignore case</icon> switch); if any other character follows the <code>\</code>, both will be ignored.  If <icon>Allow control chars</icon> is off, no conversion takes place and <code>\t</code> would match the text <code>\t</code> in the file.

<box type="info">
Since searching file contents takes time, this check will only occur if all the other criteria set have been checked and found to match.  For this reason, it is a good idea to try and narrow down the search as much as possible (for example by specifying a list of filetypes to try, or a filename if known).
</box>

</chapter>




<chapter title="Saving Searches" file="Hotlist">

Sooner or later, some searches used in <cite>Locate</cite> will prove to be useful enough that it would be helpful to be able to repeat them. To assist with this, various options are available including the hotlist and saved settings files.

The settings from previous searches can always be recalled into the <window>search</window> dialogue. If the <window>results</window> window is still on screen (either from the original search, or from reloading a set of results into <cite>Locate</cite>), then selecting <menu>Modify search...</menu> from the window's menu will open the <window>search</window> dialogue with the same settings ready to be modified or re-used intact. In addition, clicking <mouse>adjust</mouse> on <cite>Locate</cite>'s iconbar icon will recall the settings used for the last search to have been carried out.


<subhead title="Saving search settings">

In addition to saving the settings of a search with its results, they can be saved into a file on their own which can then be used to start a new search. This can be done from a <window>results</window> window by selecting <menu>Save &msep; Search options &msep;</menu> from the menu; the settings from a <window>search</window> dialogue can also be saved directly via the <menu>Save search &msep;</menu> entry in its menu.

Double-clicking on a saved settings file, or dropping one on to <cite>Locate</cite>'s iconbar icon, will open a <window>search</window> dialogue with the correct values set up. They can also be added to the hotlist, as described below.


<subhead title="The hotlist">

In addition to saved searches, <cite>Locate</cite> contains a hotlist, which can be accessed via the <menu>Hotlist...</menu> entry in the iconbar menu. This opens up the <window>hotlist</window> window, revealing a filer-like repository for storing searches: the main differences are that items in the hotlist can be arranged in any order, can have more descriptive names, and can be accessed from <cite>Locate</cite>'s iconbar menu (either via the <window>hotlist</window> window, or via the corresponding entry in the <menu>Hotlist... &msep;</menu> submenu on the iconbar.

Search settings can be added to the hotlist by selecting <menu>Add to hotlist...</menu> from the <window>results</window> window menu. This will open the <window>Add search to hotlist</window> window, into which a name can be entered; clicking on <icon>Add</icon> will then add the search settings to the hotlist. Settings can also be added via the <menu>Add to hotlist...</menu> entry in the <window>search</window> dialogue's menu. Items in the list can be re-ordered by dragging them around with the mouse.

Searches in the <window>hotlist</window> window can be accessed by double-clicking on their icons, or by selecting them and clicking on the <icon>run</icon> button in the toolbar. They can be renamed by selecting them and choosing <menu>Entry &msep; Rename...</menu> from the menu, or by clicking on the <icon>rename</icon> button in the toolbar. Selected entries can be deleted with <menu>Entry &msep; Delete</menu> from the menu, or the <icon>delete</icon> button in the toolbar. The selection itself can be manipulated using the <menu>Select all</menu> and <menu>Clear selection</menu> entries in the menu, or by clicking <mouse>select</mouse> or <mouse>adjust</mouse> respectively on the <icon>selection</icon> button in the toolbar.

The contents of the hotlist is saved automatically when <cite>Locate</cite> exits. Its contents can also be saved into a separate hotlist file using the <menu>Save hotlist</menu> menu item, or by clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on the <icon>save</icon> button in the toolbar; if there is a selection, then it is possible to include just these entries in the saved file. Saved hotlist files can be dropped into a <window>hotlist</window> window to add the searches that they contain to the list.

Finally, individual saved searches can be added to the hotlist window by dragging their files to the window (either saved settings or full results files). They can also be saved out by dragging them, by using <menu>Entry &msep; Save search &msep;</menu> or by clicking <mouse>adjust</mouse> on the <icon>save</icon> button in the toolbar.

<chapter title="Configuration" file="Configuration">

Selecting <menu>Choices...</menu> from its iconbar menu allows the default behaviour of <cite>Locate</cite> to be changed.

The <icon>Default search options</icon> section controls how the search options are set for new searches (these are remembered along with the other parameters for recalled searches).  The <icon>Search directories</icon> field contains the default directories to be searched: either type a path in or drag an object into the field. As with the corresponding field in the <window>search</window> dialogue, multiple paths can be entered separated by commas; dragging objects to the field will add to these unless <key>shift</key> is held down &ndash; in which case the new path will replace those already present.  <icon>Store all file details</icon>, <icon>Ignore Image FSs' contents</icon>, <icon>Suppress FS errors</icon> and <icon>Full info display</icon> are the same as those in the <window>search</window> dialogue.

The <icon>Plugin behaviour</icon> section is only available to users of RISC&nbsp;OS <cite>Select</cite>, where <cite>Locate</cite> can act as a plugin for the <menu>Find</menu> option in the Filer.  <icon>Quit after use (no icon)</icon> determines how <cite>Locate</cite> behaves if it is started by the Filer to deal with a search.  If selected, no icon is placed on the icon bar and <cite>Locate</cite> will quit as soon as all its windows have been closed.  If not, <cite>Locate</cite> will behave as though it was loaded by the user.  If <icon>Open search window</icon> is selected, the search window will open after <menu>Find</menu> is selected in the Filer, with the relevant fields filled in.  If it is not selected, the <link ref="Results">results window</link> will open immediately; the search can be stopped and the parameters altered using the menu in the normal way.  Fully disabling the plugin operation must be done from within the <file>!Boot</file> and <file>!Run</file> files of <cite>Locate</cite>: see the <link ref="Plugin">Filer Action Plugin</link> section for details.

When <icon>Scroll to new matches</icon> is on, the <link ref="Results">results window</link> scrolls down as new matches are found so that the last entry is always visible.  When off, the window does not scroll and new matches may be added out of sight.

If <icon>Check paths on loading</icon> is set, <cite>Locate</cite> will validate each of the paths in the <icon>Search directories</icon> field of the <window>choices</window> dialogue (described above) whenever it loads; if any are invalid, it will warn of this and offer the chance to edit them. If you do not wish this check to take place, turn the option off (and save the new settings so that they persist when <cite>Locate</cite> is quit).

Click on <icon>Apply</icon> to use the changes or <icon>Save</icon> to save them and then use them (in both cases <mouse>adjust</mouse> will keep the window open).  Click on <icon>Cancel</icon> with <mouse>select</mouse> to close the window and forget the changes; click with <mouse>adjust</mouse> to reset the window contents to the state they were in when the window was last opened.


<subhead title="Other configuration options">

There are a few configuration options that are not included in the <window>choices</window> dialogue.  These are features that most users will not need to alter, but they can help in some specific cases.

The extra options are set by adding tokens to <cite>Locate</cite>'s <file>Choices</file> file.  This will be stored as <file>Choices:Locate.Choices</file> on machines with the new boot structure (ie. anything running RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.5 or later); if not, it will be found at <file>!Locate.Choices</file>.  If the file is in neither of these locations, open the <window>choices window</window> and click on <icon>Save</icon> to cause a blank file to be written out.

There are two options that can be set.  The first is <code>PathBufSize</code>, which is the size in bytes of the <icon>Search in</icon> field in the <window>search window</window>.  By default this is 4095 bytes long (4K); if you find yourself getting the message "There was not enough space in the search path buffer to add the new path" from <cite>Locate</cite>, you should increase this value.

The second option is <code>OSGBPBReadSize</code>.  This determines the maximum number of objects that <cite>Locate</cite> will read each time it gets catalogue information from the disc it is searching.  The default of reading up to 1000 items in one go makes the searches significantly faster. If necessary, this can be reduced to resolve problems with some filing systems; for example, setting the number of objects read to 1, so that <cite>Locate</cite> will get each set of details separately. This will slow the search down.

To set these options, load the <file>Choices</file> file into a text editor and add the options you require.  Each option should go on a new line.  An example file, containing a few options from the <window>choices window</window> might look like this:

<codeblock>
# >ADFS::Gromit.$.!BOOT.Choices.Locate.Choices
#
# Config file for Locate
# Last automatically generated on Fri,02 Aug 2002

SearchPath: ADFS::Wallace.$.Programming
PathBufSize: 8190
OSGBPBReadSize: 1
</codeblock>

This will set the <icon>Search in</icon> field to 8K long (8190 bytes) and read one object at a time.  <code>SearchPath</code> is set from the <window>choices window</window> and can be ignored.  The lines starting with <code>#</code> are comments and are ignored by <cite>Locate</cite>; blank lines are also ignored.

Once the file has been changed and saved, quit and re-start <cite>Locate</cite> for the new options to take effect.  The extra entries in the file will be preserved if the choices are saved in the normal way from the <window>choices</window> dialogue.

If you manage to corrupt the <file>Choices</file> file, it can be deleted and <cite>Locate</cite> will create a new copy when the choices are next saved.  You will, however, lose any non-default settings you had made.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Filer Action Plugin" file="Plugin">

<cite>Locate</cite> acts as a Filer Action Plugin under RISC&nbsp;OS <cite>Select</cite>, so that the <menu>Find</menu> option in the Filer menu causes <cite>Locate</cite> to be used instead of the standard search.

For this to work, click the mouse or press <key>return</key> over the text field of the <menu>Find</menu> option.  Any text that is entered will be put into the <icon>Object name</icon> field of the search window, and selected applications and directories are put into the <icon>Search in</icon> field.  Any files selected at the time will be ignored, as <cite>Locate</cite> can not search for files <em>in</em> files; if the current selection consists entirely of files, the parent directory is used instead.

This feature can be disabled if required.  <key>Shift</key>-double-click on <file>!Locate</file> and load the <file>!Boot</file> and <file>!Run</file> files into a text editor (<key>shift</key>-double-click on them).  Find the line in each file that reads:

<codeblock>
Set Alias$@FilerAction_Find Run &lt;Obey$Dir&gt;.!Run -plugin
</codeblock>

Comment it out by inserting a vertical bar in front of it, like this:

<codeblock>
|Set Alias$@FilerAction_Find Run &lt;Obey$Dir&gt;.!Run -plugin
</codeblock>

Re-save the two files and after the machine has been re-started <cite>Locate</cite> will no longer behave as a plugin.

To restore the plugin action, repeat the process but remove the vertical bar.

Other details of the plugin operation can be set from the <link ref="Configuration">choices window</link>.

</chapter>

<chapter title="Future Plans" file="ToDo">

This version of <cite>Locate</cite> is still not finished and several intended features are not yet implemented.  A list of my future plans is included here; if there is something that you think would be useful that isn't on this list, let me know (my email address is on the index page).

<list>
<li>Cache search results or file locations in a file for faster searching.
<li>Correctly measure icon sprite widths when laying out the results window.
<li>Search the contents of Squashed files.
<li>Allow actions to be carried out on found objects (set type, delete, etc.).
<li>Give the search in field a drop-down menu listing the individual paths; toggle each on and off, and open individual entries?
<li>Allow Regular Expressions to be used in file contents search.
<li>Allow searches of search results.
<li>Add stop/modify search buttons to the status bar (or toolbar).
<li>Make <window>search window</window> opening configurable, so that any pane can be opened by default.
