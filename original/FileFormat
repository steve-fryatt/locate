File contains a set of search results (searching for files and directories
on a disc), along with the search parameters for the search.

The format consists of a 12 byte header, containing a Magic Word, version and flags, followed by blocks of data.  Each block is preceded by its length (stored in a word); the number of blocks is inferred by the version number or by encountering an EOF.  Blocks can be zero length (in which case they just have a length word of zero); in this situation the data isn't present (so a file could just contain settings, for example).

The current version number is 1; the version word may be subdivided up.
Note that search parameter files (no results) can still be saved as version 0 to allow back compatibility.


Offset  Data
------  ----
0	Magic Word 'SRCH'
4	File Version (currently 1)
8	Flags (reserved, must all be zero)

12	Length of data block
16...	Data Block

a	Length of title block
a+4...	Title Block

b	Length of settings block
b+4...	Settings block


The individual blocks contain internal data from Locate.  The data block contains (items in brackets indicate internal useage):

Offset	Data
------	----
0	Zero (pointer to next data block)
4	Zero (pointer to window redraw data)
8	Zero (window handle)
12	Number of items in list
16	Zero (pointer to search options; as per Settings Block)
20	Zero (number of selections in window)
24	Zero (matches found at last window update)
28	Length of block header - 44 (data pointer at last window update)
32	Zero (window handle of pane)
36	Display flags
40	Results entry height in OS units.
44      Zero (pointer to file info block)
48      Zero (number of selectable items)

52	Start of data
	Each entry contains:
		<Path name of match>+CHR$13
		"S"+<sprite name for file>+CHR$13
		Flag byte

The title block contains the text of the window title, CHR$13 terminated.

The settings block contains:

Offset	Data
------	----
0	Flags word (zero)
4	Total length of block

8	Start of data
