 flexible set of criteria. Filenames can include wildcards and matches can
 depend on file size, modification date, file type, file attributes or file
 contents.

 The objects shown in the match window can be easily accessed: files and
 applications can be run directly and directories opened. It is also easy to
 view the files by opening their parent directories. The results of a search
 can be saved out to disc for future reference or so that the search
 parameters can be re-used.
